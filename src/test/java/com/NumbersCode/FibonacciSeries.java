	 * For example, if we want to compute the 3rd term of the series, then it is the sum of the 1st and the 2nd term. Note that 
	 * the first two terms of the Fibonacci series are defined as 0 and 1. Thus, the 3rd term will be 0 + 1 = 1. The 4th 
	 * term will be the sum of the 3rd and the 2nd terms, 1 + 1 = 2. The 5th term will be the sum of the 4th and the 3rd term, 
	 * which is 2 + 1 = 3. Thus the Fibonacci series looks like the following. 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, â€¦ 
	 * (considering 1 - indexing)

	Therefore, in general, the nth term of the series can be written as
	
	F(n) = F(n - 1) + F(n - 2)
